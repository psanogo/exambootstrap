# <h1>Getting Started with your Lab Sandbox</h1>
# <p>You can find important course-specific tips and notes for your Lab Sandbox in this <br>
#     quick guide to use throughout your course. Youâ€™ll be able to reference this at any time <br>
#     or visit the <a href="https://learner.coursera.help/hc/articles/360062301971">Learner Help Center</a>
#     for more info. </p>
#     
# <h2>What tools are already installed in my sandbox environment?</h2>
# <ul>
#   <li>Python 3</li>
#   <li>R </li>
#   <li>numpy</li>
#   <li>matplotlib</li>
#   <li>gfortran</li>
#   <li>math</li>
# </ul>
# 
# <h2>How can I run Python in <b>terminal</b> in the Lab Sandbox?</h2>
# <ol>Type <b>python[version]</b> followed by your filename. For example, python3 filename.py </ol>   
# 
# <h2>How can I run Python in a Jupyter Notebook in the Lab Sandbox?</h2>
# <ol>For any Python visualizations needed, you can select the Python kernel in your sandbox <br>
#     by creating a "New" notebook with the Python 3 kernel type. </ol>

# <h2>Additional Course Specific Notes:</h2>
#     
# <ul>
# <br>
#     <li><b>IMPORTANT: To optimize your notebook performance, please shut down each of your <br>
#         open/running Jupyter Notebooks after you complete them within your Lab</b>. <br>
#         This will provide full and dedicated system resources to the current lab assignment<br>
#         you are working on in your Lab Sandbox. If you experience any unexpected slow <br>
#         processing in your notebook, try to restart your Lab kernel and only open that single <br>
#         notebook to complete your work. You can learn more about restarting your Lab Sandbox <br>
#         and troubleshooting your lab in our Learner Help Center article <a href="https://learner.coursera.help/hc/articles/360044758731-Solving-Common-Issues-with-Coursera-Labs">here</a>.</li><br>
#     <li>If anything is unclear regarding the course content, please go through the Discussion board and see if your question has been answered. <br>If you have any issues with the Jupyter enviornment itself, please contact Coursera through the <a href="https://learner.coursera.help">Learner Help Center.</a></li><br>
